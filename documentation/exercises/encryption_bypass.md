# Encrypted Field Data Access Bypass

## Salesforce

You can perform a deployment of the [PaaS Cloud Goat](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/paas-cloud-goat) to a Salesforce Developer Edition organization. Ensure that you pre-populate sample test data as per the [Install](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/paas-cloud-goat/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL.md) instructions.

The live workshop will provide a pre-deployed test environment for you.

The end goal is to retrieve the cleartext data from the encrypted field as a standard user using an SOQL injection bypass.

### Tips:

- Use the SOQLInjection3 example for your exploit attempts.
